Not even 3 weeks left until the best RailsCamp ever – time to start warming up
and announcing things! But first off, a big thank you to everybody who already
contributed something, anything, to this unconference extraordinaire! You're
many, and it's going great so far. Keep it up!

Let's begin with a short (obviously incomplete) summary of the current state of
organization. Please dive in and help out with anything you like[^foot-1], even if it's
just adding useful information to the comments:

* We'll have a [beer garden](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/27)
  and a large [hack tent](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/16)
  with beach chairs n stuff outside, and we can officially make noise there until 5am. The
  [warm-up party](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/36)
  will also take place there, so if you want, you seriously don't have to leave
  the venue at all from Friday until Sunday.
* The setup indoors [is](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/21)
  [pretty](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/29)
  [much](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/23)
  [sorted](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/13)
  [out](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/3), and
  fortunately most of the material doesn't even have to be shipped there, because
  the venue comes with all sorts of things like chairs, stage elements, etc.
* [We still need some
  projectors](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/28)
  (or how the Germans among us like to call them: beamers). If you can bring one,
  please add a comment to the issue!
* There's going to be a [Railscamp 5k Run](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/14)
* We'll have [über-awesome wi-fi](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/9),
  courtesy of the CCC
* We're still trying to get a proper [Internet
  uplink](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/34)
  secured. Hope for the best, or help get it done!
* Our campers and Sailor sponsors of
  [Geekstammtisch](http://geekstammtisch.de/) will [set up their podcasting
  studio](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/37) at the
  venue, and will probably even do live recording sessions if you're interested.
  Furthermore, we'll have a freelance journalist [creating a short
  movie](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/15) about the
  camp.
* [Ticket sales](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/8)
  are going well so far (more on that in the next post), and most of the first
  batch is gone. Fun fact: at the time of this writing, you contributed the
  average amount of 7 EUR more per ticket than the suggested price. Thank you,
  everybody!
* We have a quote for a [coffee
  truck](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/17) (with
  flat rate and optional crêpe unit), but we still need sponsors for it
  (~500/day).  Anyone interested in making *a lot* of campers *very* happy?
* [Rails Girls](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/30)
  will be officially part of the camp with sessions, app hacking, and more.
  Separate announcement/invitation coming up. Thanks to everybody involved in
  this so far!

That's it for today's status update. As you can see, we're unstoppable by now,
and it's only getting even better by the day. **Thanks again to everybody who
contributed so far!** And see you tomorrow for our next announcement!
