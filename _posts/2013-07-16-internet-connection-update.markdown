Internet Connection Update

This is a quick update on the internet connection that we will have at the venue.  For transparency reasons we thought it is just fair to let you in on current state and we also wanted to ask if anybody can help out.

**The Problem**:  The venue itself only has a tiny 2 Mbit DSL connection that won't get us very far and all our efforts so far to get partners for a really decent and affordable/sponsored alternative have failed.  We have talked to NetCologne, T-Mobile and Vodafone but so far nobody felt responsible for our kind of event.

**The Solution So Far**:  We have found a service provider that will provide us with hardware to bundle multiple LTE and other internet sources, however in addition to the rental costs for the hardware we would need to pay a price of ~8.50€ per GB for LTE data, which would probably kill our event budget pretty quickly.

We are also looking at the option of "Richtfunk", but unfortunately it's quite hard to get access to a high building within sight of the venue.

**How can you help?**

Do you have any connections to any of the big LTE/UMTS providers in Germany and could help us get SIM cards with a decent data price?

Does anybody have connections to people having access to any higher buildings in Köln Kalk to place a Richtfunk antenna?

Do you have any other idea how to get decent, affordable internet to a remote urban location?


PS:  The Railscamp is taking place no matter what and we will have a great time.  There are already participants talking about creating local rubygems mirrors ;)
