**TL;DR:** This is a quick update on the Internet connection at the venue.
Maybe we could use your help. [^foot-1]

### The problem

The venue itself only has a tiny 2 Mb/s DSL connection that won't help us much
and our efforts to get partners for a decent and affordable or sponsored
alternative have not succeeded so far. We've had contact with NetCologne,
T-Mobile and Vodafone, but we couldn't reach the right people there for our
type of event.

### The current solutions

We found a service provider that will provide us with hardware to bundle
multiple LTE and other Internet sources. However, in addition to the rental
costs for the hardware, we'd need to pay ~8.50€ per GB for LTE data beyond an
allowance of 50GB, which might exceed our budget rather quickly.

We're also looking at the option of a directional wi-fi connection from
somewhere with a better uplink, but it's not easy to get access to a tall
building within sight of the venue.

### Can you help?

* Do you have any contacts at one of the big LTE/UMTS providers in Germany and
could help RailsCamp get sponsored SIM cards for the weekend, or a proper
discount on traffic costs?

* Do you know somebody with access to a taller building in Köln Kalk to place a
directional antenna?

* Do you have any other idea how to get decent, affordable Internet to a remote
urban location?

Details are available [on the according GitHub issue](https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/34),
which is also the best way for you to contribute. Thanks!
