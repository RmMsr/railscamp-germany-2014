  <h1>Contribute</h1>

  <p>RailsCamp Germany is a non-profit event <strong>"for the community, from the community"</strong>, therefore it is essential that as many people as possible help us to make this a great event for everybody.  Any little help is appreciated, no contribution is too small.</p>

  <h2>Help with event organization</h2>

  <p>As a decentralized organization team, we’ve set up some tools to help us collaborate remotely. If you want to get get involved before the event, check out what we already have, find something you’d like to help with or add something new, and join the conversation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues?state=open">GitHub Issues</a> on the event repo are our main organization channel. Just pick an issue that you want to help with, create issues that are missing, or provide helpful information on existing issues.</li>
    <li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net:7000/railcamp_de">#railscamp_de</a> on Freenode is our offical IRC channel. Just drop by anytime.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railscamp2013">orga mailing list</a> is the only non-public channel, which we only use for confidential information. If you want access, just request it. It’s not necessary for anything other than looking at a few boring numbers, though. ;)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We’re also doing regular Google Hangouts every Tuesday at 5pm. The URL is always shared on both IRC and Twitter.</p>

  <h2>Organize a session</h2>

  <p>The Railscamp is organized like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">Barcamp</a>, so the content of the event depends on you, the participants.  You can help to make it awesome by planning a great session and pitching it to the other participants.  Session can be related to Rails & Development, but also anything(!) else that you are excited about.  Example sessions could be things like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"My awesome new gem"</li>
    <li>"This cool new feature in Rails 4</li>
    <li>"You are doing it wrong!"</li>
    <li>"Anonymous Coffee Nerd Support Group"</li>
    <li>"Bike repairing 101"</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>So, get going and start thinking about your own session!</strong></p>
